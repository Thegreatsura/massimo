# Contributing to Massimo

Welcome to the Massimo development guide! This document will help you set up your development environment and contribute to the project.

## Project Overview

Massimo is an API SDK client and CLI tool for creating clients for remote OpenAPI or GraphQL APIs. This is a pnpm workspace monorepo with 2 packages.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 22.18 or higher
- **pnpm**: Package manager (follow the [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- **Docker** (optional): Only required for running integration tests ([Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima))

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platformatic/massimo.git
cd massimo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Link CLI Tools Globally

To use the `massimo` command globally during development:

```bash
pnpm run global-links
```

Verify the setup:

```bash
massimo --version
```

### 4. Setup Docker Environment (Optional)

This step is only required if you plan to run integration tests. Choose the appropriate Docker Compose file for your system:

**Intel Macs:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-mac.yml up -d
```

**Apple Silicon Macs:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-apple-silicon.yml up -d
```

**Windows/Linux:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Development workflow
pnpm test              # Run all tests (uses Docker for databases)
pnpm run build         # Build all packages
pnpm run lint          # Lint all packages
pnpm run gen-schema    # Generate JSON schemas
pnpm run gen-types     # Generate TypeScript types

# Cleanup commands
pnpm clean             # Clean node_modules in all packages
pnpm cleanall          # Clean everything including lockfile

# Testing individual packages
cd packages/<package-name>
npm test               # Run tests for specific package

# Version management
./scripts/sync-version.sh  # Sync versions across all packages
```

### Testing

Tests may require Docker for some integration scenarios. The test script automatically selects the appropriate Docker Compose file based on your OS.

```bash
pnpm test
```

**Test Configuration:**

- Tests run with concurrency=1 and extended timeouts (300000ms)
- Pre-commit hooks enforce linting
- All tests must pass before opening a pull request

**Troubleshooting Tests:**

If tests fail without code changes:

1. Clean the environment:

```bash
pnpm cleanall
```

2. Clear pnpm store and reinstall:

```bash
pnpm store path
rm -rf /path/from/previous/command
pnpm install
```

### Working with Individual Packages

To work on a specific package:

```bash
cd packages/<package-name>
npm test                    # Run package tests
npm run build              # Build package
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components (packages/)

- **massimo**: Client library for creating clients for remote OpenAPI or GraphQL APIs
- **massimo-cli**: CLI tool for generating client code (`massimo` command)

### Client Generation Capabilities

- **OpenAPI**: Generate TypeScript clients from OpenAPI specifications
- **GraphQL**: Generate TypeScript clients from GraphQL schemas
- **Frontend Integration**: Support for various frontend frameworks
- **Authentication**: Support for headers and authentication configuration

## Development Guidelines

### Workspace Dependencies

- Use `workspace:*` for internal package dependencies
- All packages share the same version
- Dependencies are replaced by precise versions during publish by pnpm

### Configuration

- JSON Schema validation for all configuration files
- Supports JSON, YAML, and TOML config formats
- Uses neostandard ESLint configuration

### API Support

Supports any backend that exposes OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas. The client generator is backend-agnostic with automatic client code generation for TypeScript and JavaScript.

### Package Structure Patterns

- Each package has its own `package.json` with consistent scripts
- TypeScript definitions are auto-generated
- Generated clients follow consistent patterns for different API types (OpenAPI/GraphQL)
- Client generation follows OpenAPI and GraphQL specification standards

## Testing Your Local Changes

To test your local changes with client generation:

1. Ensure CLI tools are linked globally:

```bash
pnpm run global-links
```

2. Create a test directory:

```bash
mkdir test-client
cd test-client
```

3. Generate a client from a remote API:

```bash
massimo http://example.com/openapi.json --name testclient
```

4. Test the generated client in your application.

## Documentation

### Writing Guides

When creating documentation guides, follow this structured approach:

1. **Introduction**: Explain the "why" and "what" - what problem does this solve and what will be accomplished
2. **Setup Instructions**: Detailed setup steps with prerequisites and environment preparation
3. **Implementation Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for the demo/tutorial (numbered 3...X)
4. **Conclusion**: Clear summary of what was accomplished and next steps

**Additional Requirements:**

- Include architecture diagrams to illustrate the solution
- Focus on client generation examples and API integration patterns
- Prefer using existing project demos and real-world examples over creating artificial examples
- Test all code examples and commands before publishing
- Create a short video demonstration for each guide to complement the written instructions

### Building Documentation Locally

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) and requires both the main Massimo repository and the separate [docs repository](https://github.com/platformatic/docs).

**Setup:**

1. Create a working directory and clone both repositories:

```bash
mkdir /workdir && cd /workdir
git clone https://github.com/platformatic/massimo.git
git clone https://github.com/platformatic/docs.git
```

2. Install dependencies in both repositories:

```bash
cd massimo && npm install && cd ..
cd docs && npm install
```

3. Set up the environment and start the development server:

```bash
export DOCS=`realpath $PWD/../massimo/docs`
npm run sync-and-start
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass: `pnpm test`
2. Run linting: `pnpm run lint`
3. Build all packages: `pnpm run build`

### Creating a Pull Request

1. If your PR fixes a GitHub issue, add this at the top of the PR description:

```
fixes #<issue-number>
```

2. Ensure all checks pass and get approval
3. Merge using "squash and merge" option

## Release Process

Massimo packages share the same release number and are released together.

1. Update version in root `package.json`
2. Sync versions across packages:

```bash
./scripts/sync-version.sh
```

3. Publish the release:

```bash
pnpm -r publish --access=public
```

## Troubleshooting

### SQLite Module CPU Architecture Issues

If you encounter SQLite-related errors:

1. Ensure pnpm was not installed with volta
2. Clean and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf ./node_modules
pnpm store prune
pnpm store path
rm -rf /path/from/the/above/command
pnpm install
```

### "env: node: No such file or directory"

1. Check pnpm installation: `which pnpm`
2. Ensure correct Node.js version is active
3. Reinstall pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm`

## Navigation Tools

Generate a `tags` file for code navigation:

```bash
ctags --exclude=node_modules --exclude='**/*.test.js' --exclude='**/build' -R *
```

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All contributions must include a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off. Use the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This automatically adds your `Signed-off-by` line to the commit message. If working with AI assistance, ensure both contributors are signed off.
